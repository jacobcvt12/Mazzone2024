# Clinical validation of a cell-free DNA fragmentome assay for augmentation of lung cancer early detection

This approach shows the code for calculating figures 2, 3, 4, and 5. Please note that in figure 2 and 3, we share the code to generate these figures but are using data made available from Mathios 2021 in this repo. In figure 4, we use simulated. In figure 5, we show how to make the figure.
