# Clinical validation of a cell-free DNA fragmentome assay for augmentation of lung cancer early detection

This repository provides code used to generate figures 2 - 5 of Mazzone et al.  Please note that in figures 2 and 3, we share the code used to generate these figures but we are using data from Mathios et al., 2021.  For figure 4, we use simulated data. For figure 5, we use the results from the simulation in Mazzone et al. to create the figure.
